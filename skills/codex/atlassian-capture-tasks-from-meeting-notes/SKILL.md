## Overview

Automatically extract action items from meeting notes and create Jira tasks with proper assignees. This skill parses unstructured meeting notes (from Confluence or pasted text), identifies action items with assignees, looks up Jira account IDs, and creates tasks—eliminating the tedious post-meeting ticket creation process.

**Use this skill when:** Users have meeting notes with action items that need to become Jira tasks.

---

## Workflow

Follow this 7-step process to turn meeting notes into actionable Jira tasks:

### Step 1: Get Meeting Notes

Obtain the meeting notes from the user.

#### Option A: Confluence Page URL

If user provides a Confluence URL:

```
getConfluencePage(
  cloudId="...",
  pageId="[extracted from URL]",
  contentFormat="markdown"
)
```

**URL patterns:**
- `https://[site].atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/[SPACE]/pages/[PAGE_ID]/[title]`
- Extract PAGE_ID from the numeric portion
- Get cloudId from site name or use `getAccessibleAtlassianResources`

#### Option B: Pasted Text

If user pastes meeting notes directly:
- Use the text as-is
- No fetching needed

#### If Unclear

Ask: "Do you have a Confluence link to the meeting notes, or would you like to paste them directly?"

---

### Step 2: Parse Action Items

Scan the notes for action items with assignees.

#### Common Patterns

**Pattern 1: @mention format** (highest priority)
```
@Sarah to create user stories for chat feature
@Mike will update architecture doc
```

**Pattern 2: Name + action verb**
```
Sarah to create user stories
Mike will update architecture doc
Lisa should review the mockups
```

**Pattern 3: Action: Name - Task**
```
Action: Sarah - create user stories
Action Item: Mike - update architecture
```

**Pattern 4: TODO with assignee**
```
TODO: Create user stories (Sarah)
TODO: Update docs - Mike
```

**Pattern 5: Bullet with name**
```
- Sarah: create user stories
- Mike - update architecture
```

#### Extraction Logic

**For each action item, extract:**

1. **Assignee Name**
   - Text after @ symbol
   - Name before "to", "will", "should"
   - Name after "Action:" or in parentheses
   - First/last name or full name

2. **Task Description**
   - Text after "to", "will", "should", "-", ":"
   - Remove markers (@, Action:, TODO:)
   - Keep original wording
   - Include enough context

3. **Context** (optional but helpful)
   - Meeting title/date if available
   - Surrounding discussion context
   - Related decisions

#### Example Parsing

**Input:**
```
# Product Planning - Dec 3

Action Items:
- @Sarah to create user stories for chat feature
- Mike will update the architecture doc
- Lisa: review and approve design mockups
```

**Parsed:**
```
1. Assignee: Sarah
   Task: Create user stories for chat feature
   Context: Product Planning meeting - Dec 3

2. Assignee: Mike
   Task: Update the architecture doc
   Context: Product Planning meeting - Dec 3

3. Assignee: Lisa
   Task: Review and approve design mockups
   Context: Product Planning meeting - Dec 3
```

---

### Step 3: Ask for Project Key

Before looking up users or creating tasks, identify the Jira project.

**Ask:** "Which Jira project should I create these tasks in? (e.g., PROJ, PRODUCT, ENG)"

#### If User is Unsure

Call `getVisibleJiraProjects` to show options:

```
getVisibleJiraProjects(
  cloudId="...",
  action="create"
)
```

Present: "I found these projects you can create tasks in: PROJ (Project Alpha), PRODUCT (Product Team), ENG (Engineering)"

---

### Step 4: Lookup Account IDs

For each assignee name, find their Jira account ID.

#### Lookup Process

```
lookupJiraAccountId(
  cloudId="...",
  searchString="[assignee name]"
)
```

**The search string can be:**
- Full name: "Sarah Johnson"
- First name: "Sarah"
- Last name: "Johnson"
- Email: "sarah@company.com"

#### Handle Results

**Scenario A: Exact Match (1 result)**
```
✅ Found: Sarah Johnson (sarah.johnson@company.com)
→ Use accountId from result
```

**Scenario B: No Match (0 results)**
```
⚠️ Couldn't find user "Sarah" in Jira.

Options:
1. Create task unassigned (assign manually later)
2. Skip this task
3. Try different name format (e.g., "Sarah Johnson")

Which would you prefer?
```

**Scenario C: Multiple Matches (2+ results)**
```
⚠️ Found multiple users named "Sarah":
1. Sarah Johnson (sarah.johnson@company.com)
2. Sarah Smith (sarah.smith@company.com)

Which user should be assigned the task "Create user stories"?
```

#### Best Practices

- Try full name first ("Sarah Johnson")
- If no match, try first name only ("Sarah")
- If still no match, ask user
- Cache results (don't lookup same person twice)

---

### Step 5: Present Action Items

**CRITICAL:** Always show the parsed action items to the user BEFORE creating any tasks.

#### Presentation Format

```
I found [N] action items from the meeting notes. Should I create these Jira tasks in [PROJECT]?

1. [TASK] [Task description]
   Assigned to: [Name] ([email if found])
   Context: [Meeting title/date]

2. [TASK] [Task description]
   Assigned to: [Name] ([email if found])
   Context: [Meeting title/date]

[...continue for all tasks...]

Would you like me to:
1. Create all tasks
2. Skip some tasks (which ones?)
3. Modify any descriptions or assignees
```

#### Wait for Confirmation

Do NOT create tasks until user confirms. Options:
- "Yes, create all" → proceed
- "Skip task 3" → create all except #3
- "Change assignee for task 2" → ask for new assignee
- "Edit description" → ask for changes

---

### Step 6: Create Tasks

Once confirmed, create each Jira task.

#### Determine Issue Type

Before creating tasks, check what issue types are available in the project:

```
getJiraProjectIssueTypesMetadata(
  cloudId="...",
  projectIdOrKey="PROJ"
)
```

**Choose the appropriate issue type:**
- Use "Task" if available (most common)
- Use "Story" for user-facing features
- Use "Bug" if it's a defect
- If "Task" doesn't exist, use the first available issue type or ask the user

#### For Each Action Item

```
createJiraIssue(
  cloudId="...",
  projectKey="PROJ",
  issueTypeName="[Task or available type]",
  summary="[Task description]",
  description="[Full description with context]",
  assignee_account_id="[looked up account ID]"
)
```

#### Task Summary Format

Use action verbs and be specific:
- ✅ "Create user stories for chat feature"
- ✅ "Update architecture documentation"
- ✅ "Review and approve design mockups"
- ❌ "Do the thing" (too vague)

#### Task Description Format

```markdown
**Action Item from Meeting Notes**

**Task:** [Original action item text]

**Context:**
[Meeting title/date]
[Relevant discussion points or decisions]

**Source:** [Link to Confluence meeting notes if available]

**Original Note:**
> [Exact quote from meeting notes]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
**Action Item from Meeting Notes**

**Task:** Create user stories for chat feature

**Context:**
Product Planning Meeting - December 3, 2025
Discussed Q1 roadmap priorities and new feature requirements

**Source:** https://yoursite.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TEAM/pages/12345

**Original Note:**
> @Sarah to create user stories for chat feature
```

---

### Step 7: Provide Summary

After all tasks are created, present a comprehensive summary.

**Format:**
```
✅ Created [N] tasks in [PROJECT]:

1. [PROJ-123] - [Task summary]
   Assigned to: [Name]
   https://yoursite.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123

2. [PROJ-124] - [Task summary]
   Assigned to: [Name]
   https://yoursite.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-124

[...continue for all created tasks...]

**Source:** [Link to meeting notes]

**Next Steps:**
- Review tasks in Jira for accuracy
- Add any additional details or attachments
- Adjust priorities if needed
- Link related tickets if applicable
```

## Action Item Pattern Examples

### Pattern 1: @Mentions (Most Explicit)

```
@john to update documentation
@sarah will create the report
@mike should review PR #123
```

**Parsed:**
- Assignee: john/sarah/mike
- Task: update documentation / create the report / review PR #123

---

### Pattern 2: Name + Action Verb

```
John to update documentation
Sarah will create the report
Mike should review PR #123
Lisa needs to test the feature
```

**Parsed:**
- Assignee: name before action verb
- Task: text after "to/will/should/needs to"

---

### Pattern 3: Structured Action Format

```
Action: John - update documentation
Action Item: Sarah - create the report
AI: Mike - review PR #123
```

**Parsed:**
- Assignee: name after "Action:" and before "-"
- Task: text after "-"

---

### Pattern 4: TODO Format

```
TODO: Update documentation (John)
TODO: Create report - Sarah
[ ] Mike: review PR #123
```

**Parsed:**
- Assignee: name in parentheses or after ":"
- Task: text between TODO and assignee

---

### Pattern 5: Bullet Lists

```
- John: update documentation
- Sarah - create the report
* Mike will review PR #123
```

**Parsed:**
- Assignee: name before ":" or "-" or action verb
- Task: remaining text

---

## Handling Edge Cases

### No Action Items Found

If no action items with assignees are detected:

```
I analyzed the meeting notes but couldn't find any action items with clear assignees.

Action items typically follow patterns like:
- @Name to do X
- Name will do X
- Action: Name - do X
- TODO: X (Name)

Options:
1. I can search for TODO items without assignees
2. You can point out specific action items to create
3. I can create tasks for bullet points you specify

What would you like to do?
```

---

### Mixed Formats

If some action items have assignees and some don't:

```
I found [N] action items:
- [X] with clear assignees
- [Y] without assignees

Should I:
1. Create all [N] tasks ([X] assigned, [Y] unassigned)
2. Only create the [X] tasks with assignees
3. Ask you to assign the [Y] unassigned tasks

Which option would you prefer?
```

---

### Assignee Name Variations

If the same person is mentioned different ways:

```
Notes mention: @sarah, Sarah, Sarah J.

These likely refer to the same person. I'll look up "Sarah" once and use 
that account ID for all three mentions. Is that correct?
```

---

### Duplicate Action Items

If the same task appears multiple times:

```
I found what appears to be the same action item twice:
1. "@Sarah to create user stories" (line 15)
2. "Action: Sarah - create user stories" (line 42)

Should I:
1. Create one task (combine duplicates)
2. Create two separate tasks
3. Skip the duplicate

What would you prefer?
```

---

### Long Task Descriptions

If action item text is very long (>200 characters):

```
The task "[long text...]" is quite detailed.

Should I:
1. Use first sentence as summary, rest in description
2. Use full text as summary
3. Let you edit it to be more concise

Which would you prefer?
```

---

## Tips for High-Quality Results

### Do:
✅ Use consistent @mention format in notes  
✅ Include full names when possible  
✅ Be specific in action item descriptions  
✅ Add context (why/what/when)  
✅ Review parsed tasks before confirming  

### Don't:
❌ Mix multiple tasks for one person in one bullet  
❌ Use ambiguous names (just "John" if you have 5 Johns)  
❌ Skip action verbs (unclear what to do)  
❌ Forget to specify project  

### Best Meeting Notes Format

```
# Meeting Title - Date

Attendees: [Names]

## Decisions
[What was decided]

## Action Items
- @FullName to [specific task with context]
- @AnotherPerson will [specific task with context]
- etc.
```

## When NOT to Use This Skill

This skill is for **converting meeting action items to Jira tasks only**.

**Don't use for:**
❌ Summarizing meetings (no task creation)  
❌ Finding meeting notes (use search skill)  
❌ Creating calendar events  
❌ Sending meeting notes via email  
❌ General note-taking  

**Use only when:** Meeting notes exist and action items need to become Jira tasks.

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple @Mentions

**Input:**
```
Team Sync - Dec 3, 2025

Action Items:
- @Sarah to create user stories for chat feature
- @Mike will update the architecture doc
- @Lisa should review design mockups
```

**Process:**
1. Parse → 3 action items found
2. Project → "PROJ"
3. Lookup → Sarah (123), Mike (456), Lisa (789)
4. Present → User confirms
5. Create → PROJ-100, PROJ-101, PROJ-102

**Output:**
```
✅ Created 3 tasks in PROJ:

1. PROJ-100 - Create user stories for chat feature
   Assigned to: Sarah Johnson
   
2. PROJ-101 - Update the architecture doc
   Assigned to: Mike Chen
   
3. PROJ-102 - Review design mockups
   Assigned to: Lisa Park
```

---

### Example 2: Mixed Formats

**Input:**
```
Product Review Meeting

Discussed new features and priorities.

Follow-ups:
- Sarah will draft the PRD
- Mike: implement API changes
- TODO: Review security audit (Lisa)
- Update stakeholders on timeline
```

**Process:**
1. Parse → Found 4 items (3 with assignees, 1 without)
2. Ask → "Found 3 with assignees, 1 without. Create all or only assigned?"
3. User → "All, make the last one unassigned"
4. Create → 4 tasks (3 assigned, 1 unassigned)

---

### Example 3: Name Lookup Issue

**Input:**
```
Sprint Planning

Action Items:
- @John to update tests
- @Sarah to refactor code
```

**Process:**
1. Parse → 2 action items
2. Lookup "John" → Found 3 Johns!
3. Ask → "Which John? (John Smith, John Doe, John Wilson)"
4. User → "John Smith"
5. Create → Both tasks assigned correctly

---

## Quick Reference

**Primary tool:** `getConfluencePage` (if URL) or use pasted text  
**Account lookup:** `lookupJiraAccountId(searchString)`  
**Task creation:** `createJiraIssue` with `assignee_account_id`  

**Action patterns to look for:**
- `@Name to/will/should X`
- `Name to/will/should X`
- `Action: Name - X`
- `TODO: X (Name)`
- `Name: X`

**Always:**
- Present parsed tasks before creating
- Handle name lookup failures gracefully
- Include context in task descriptions
- Provide summary with links

**Remember:**
- Human-in-loop is critical (show before creating)
- Name lookup can fail (have fallback)
- Be flexible with pattern matching
- Context preservation is important
