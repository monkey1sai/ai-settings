Blender is the free and open-source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline: modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, motion tracking and video editing.

Blender provides a consistent experience across Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems via OpenGL.

Blender has a wide variety of tools making it suitable for almost any sort of media production. Professionals, hobbyists, and studios around the world use it for creating animations, game assets, motion graphics, TV shows, concept art, story-boarding, commercials, and feature films.

Check out the User Stories page on the Blender website for more examples.

Blender is a fully integrated 3D content creation suite, offering a broad range of essential tools, including Modeling, Rendering, Animation & Rigging, Video Editing, VFX, Compositing, Texturing, and many types of Simulations.

It is cross platform, with an OpenGL GUI that is uniform on all major platforms (and customizable with Python scripts).

It has a high-quality 3D architecture, enabling fast and efficient creation workflow.

It boasts active community support. See blender.org/community for an extensive list of sites.

It can be installed into and run from any directory without modifying the system.

You can download the latest version of Blender here.

Blender makes it possible to perform a wide range of tasks, and it may seem daunting when first trying to grasp the basics. However, with a bit of motivation and the right learning material, it is possible to familiarize yourself with Blender after a few hours of practice.

This manual is a good start, though it serves more as a reference. There are also many online video tutorials from specialized websites.

Despite everything Blender can do, it remains a tool. Great artists do not create masterpieces by pressing buttons or manipulating brushes, but by learning and practicing subjects such as human anatomy, composition, lighting, animation principles, etc.

3D creation software such as Blender have an added technical complexity and jargon associated with the underlying technologies. Terms like UV maps, materials, shaders, meshes, and “subdivs” are the media of the digital artist, and understanding them, even broadly, will help you to use Blender to its best.

So keep reading this manual, learn the great tool that Blender is, and keep your mind open to other artistic and technological areas – and you, too, can become a great artist.

## About Free Software and the GPL¶

**URL:** https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/getting_started/about/license.html

- About Free Software and the GPL¶

When one hears about “free software”, the first thing that comes to mind might be “no cost”. While this is often true, the term “free software” as used by the Free Software Foundation (originators of the GNU Project and creators of the GNU General Public License) is intended to mean “free as in freedom” rather than in the sense of “no cost” (which is usually referred to as “free as in free beer” or gratis). Free software in this sense is software which you are free to use, copy, modify, redistribute, with no limit. Contrast this with the licensing of most commercial software packages, where you are allowed to load the software on a single computer, are allowed to make no copies, and never see the source code. Free software allows incredible freedom to the end user. Since the source code is universally available, there are also many more chances for bugs to be caught and fixed.

When a program is licensed under the GNU General Public License (the GPL):

You have the right to use the program for any purpose.

You have the right to modify the program and have access to the source codes.

You have the right to copy and distribute the program.

You have the right to improve the program, and release your own versions.

In return for these rights, you have some responsibilities if you distribute a GPL’d program. These responsibilities are designed to protect your freedoms and the freedoms of others:

You must provide a copy of the GPL with the program, so that recipients are aware of their rights under the license.

You must include the source code or make the source code freely available.

If you modify the code and distribute the modified version, you must license your modifications available under the GPL (or a compatible license).

You may not restrict the licensing of the program beyond the terms of the GPL (you may not turn a GPL’d program into a proprietary product).

For more on the GPL, check its page on the GNU Project website.

The GPL only applies to the Blender application and not the artwork you create with it; for more info see the Blender License.

## Blender’s History¶

- Version/Revision Milestones¶

Blender was created by Ton Roosendaal, a Dutch art director and self-taught software developer. Attracted to all things technical and creative, Roosendaal began a degree in Industrial Design, but dropped out in order to start his own 3D animation studio, NeoGeo, in 1989 (the video game console of the same name appeared a year later). Initially based in Roosendaal’s attic, NeoGeo grew rapidly, garnering awards and becoming the biggest company of its type in the Netherlands.

Roosendaal wrote the first source files titled “Blender” on the 2nd of January, 1994, still considered Blender’s official birthday. Originally, Blender was planned as an in-house application for NeoGeo; it grew from a series of pre-existing tools, including a ray-tracer built for the Amiga. This early version of Blender was intended to address a perennial frustration among creatives: when a difficult client requires multiple changes to a project, how do you implement those changes painlessly? Thanks to its highly configurable approach, Blender aimed at providing an answer. (As an aside: the name refers to a song by a Swiss electronic band, Yello).

Roosendaal invested his savings in a Silicon Graphics workstation. Costing the equivalent of thirty thousand US dollars, this computer led to Blender 1.0. Launched in January 1995, this first iteration of Blender proper incorporated then innovative ideas, including a single window which could be subdivided as the user saw fit.

At the time, 3D was considered commercially uninteresting. However, Roosendaal had fallen in love with what he describes as its “magical ability to create a whole world in a computer.” So when NeoGeo closed, he and partner Frank van Beek founded a new company focused on further developing and marketing Blender. Not a Number (NaN) opened its doors in June 1998, distributing Blender under a freemium pricing strategy: the software was free to download, with NaN selling keys to unlock more advanced features.

Thanks to this business model, NaN was able to fund a booth at a renowned computer graphics conference in Los Angeles, SIGGRAPH (Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques). As a consequence, Blender attracted two rounds of funding totaling some five and a half million US dollars. Despite this investment, a harsh economic climate, excess spending, and troubled relations between NaN and its investors meant that the company closed in early 2002.

With NaN’s demise, Blender’s development ceased. Unable to buy the rights from NaN’s backers, Roosendaal opted for a novel plan. In May of 2002, he started a non-profit, the Blender Foundation, with the intention of making Blender open-source. His hope was to create a public monument to Blender, and give everyone who had worked on the Blender project the chance to use it for their portfolios. In July of the same year, he launched the first-ever crowdfunding campaign: Free Blender. Thanks to Blender’s community of 250,000 users, the Blender Foundation was able to raise one hundred and ten thousand euros in just seven weeks — sufficient to regain Blender from its investors.

On Sunday, October 13th, 2002, Blender was released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, the strictest possible open-source contract. Not only would Blender be free, but its source code would remain free, forever, to be used for any purpose whatsoever.

The success of Free Blender cleared the way for a style of development that has become Blender’s defining strength. While Blender’s evolution is partly driven by grant-funded developers and guided by a core team at the Blender Foundation, Amsterdam, its greatest advantage is a global community of dedicated volunteers. Thanks to their efforts, Blender is able to iterate rapidly and respond to the needs of artists and makers. Such nimbleness and creativity would be much harder within the confines of a traditional business model.

As a way to stress-test Blender’s increasing power, the Blender Foundation challenged its community’s most talented artists to make an animated 3D short film. The only criterion was that they had to use open source tools, with Blender prime among them.

Under the codename “Project Orange,” this project began in 2005, resulting in Elephants Dream, a surreal adventure through a gigantic machine. The film and all its assets were made freely available under a Creative Commons license.

After the success of Elephants Dream, the Blender Institute was established in the summer of 2007. As well as helping to define the Blender Foundation’s goals, the Blender Institute comprised a permanent office and studio, with the express intention of generating Open Projects related to 3D movies, games or visual effects. As part of its output, the Blender Institute has created a series of Open Movies in collaboration with leading artists. They include the comedy Big Buck Bunny (2008), science fiction thriller Tears of Steel (2012), a poetic fantasy Spring (2019), and horror-comedy Sprite Fright (2021).

Each Open Project places new demands on Blender as a 3D creation suite, which in turn leads to further upgrades. While a complete list of updates is beyond the scope of this article, some milestones are worth noting.

Early 2008 saw the start of the Blender 2.5 project. This combined a major User Interface overhaul, with new tool definitions, a data access system, event handling, and a new animation system. For 2.5, the primary goal was to bring the interface standards and input methods up to date.

Cycles is Blender’s production-capable path-tracing render engine, first incorporated into release 2.61, back in 2011. Over the years, Cycles has introduced support for a wide range of rendering possibilities, including AMD and NVIDIA. Similarly, it’s grown to include support for many features including hair, motion blur, smoke and fire, major shaders and materials, adaptive subdivisions, and much more.

With its watershed 2.8 release in July, 2019, Blender broke into the 3D mainstream. Starting with a drastically revamped User Interface, the 2.8 series included a multitude of innovations, from EEVEE (a real-time render engine), to new remeshing options for sculptors, to the integration of Mantaflow, to a fully functioning 2D animation workspace that also offered the possibility of a 2D/3D hybrid workflow.

Although industry recognition for Blender had grown over the decades, 2.8 marked the moment when it was widely accepted as a legitimate alternative to paid competitors. As well as using Blender in their own projects, some of the world’s largest and most recognized companies became regular contributors to the Blender Development Fund, ensuring that Blender can continue to innovate.

As well as Blender and Open Projects made with Blender, there’s Blender Cloud. This subscription-based Open Production platform provides rolling updates on current Open Movie projects, as well as an archive of film assets in .blend file form, animation and shot breakdowns, shaders and textures, and comprehensive training videos from professional artists and developers, often those employed at Blender HQ in Amsterdam.

In total, the Blender organization numbers some twenty-eight employees, working from Amsterdam, remotely, and on a grant basis. For Blender, this team represents only a small part of a much wider community, which it defines as everyone who contributes to Blender’s development, earns their living from Blender, or simply downloads it.

The Blender mission can be summed up as “get the world’s best 3d technology in the hands of artists as open-source, and make amazing things with it.”

Going forward, Blender hopes to become a sustainable, future proof organization, dedicated to furthering its open-source philosophy, its values of curiosity and innovation, a commitment to technical excellence, and increasingly ambitious creative goals.

## Installing Blender¶

**URL:** https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/getting_started/installing/index.html

**Contents:**
- Installing Blender¶
- System Requirements¶
- Download Blender¶
- Installation Guides¶

Blender is released approximately every three months. You can keep up to date with the latest changes through the release notes.

Blender is available for download on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Always check that your graphics drivers are up to date and that OpenGL is properly supported. Blender has a set of minimum and recommended requirements; so make sure these are met before trying to install Blender.

Support for other hardware such as graphic tablets and 3D mice are covered later in Configuring Hardware.

Blender offers a variety of different binary packages to choose from depending on their level of stability. Each package has the trade off of newest features versus stability. The package that is right for you depends on your requirements for those two. A studio, for example, might want to have long-term support, while a hobbyist may want newer features, while others may just want to test upcoming features. Each package described below has something just right for everyone.

A package that contains the latest features and is considered stable without regressions. A new stable version is available roughly every three months.

A package designed for long-lasting projects requiring a very stable version of Blender. LTS releases are supported for two years and will not have any new features, API changes or improvements. A new long-term support version is available every year. These LTS releases will occasionally have minor patches (such as 4.2.6) which improve stability or fix critical bugs.

A package updated daily to include the newest changes in development. These versions are automatically built on a schedule. They are not as thoroughly tested as the release types above, and might break or crash. Builds marked as Alpha are still undergoing major changes and feature additions, while those marked Beta are feature-complete and are under development for refinement and stability.

Stability can be expected to increase from Alpha to Beta to Release Candidate (RC) to a final release.

Blender’s source code is available for free to either reference or to build and use. While normal users are not expected to compile Blender, it does have advantages:

Blender is always up to date.

It allows access to any version or branch where a feature is being developed.

It can be freely customized.

Curious users can look through the source code and make small changes to see the effects to better understand how Blender works.

The procedure for installing a binary, either the latest stable release or a daily build, is the same. Follow the steps for your platform listed below.

Blender is designed to not require an internet connection, so it doesn’t have a built-in update system. This means you will need to update Blender yourself by following the platform-specific upgrade steps described in the sections below.

## Installing from Steam¶

**URL:** https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/getting_started/installing/steam.html

**Contents:**
- Installing from Steam¶
- Updating with Steam¶

Steam is a software distribution platform. Blender can be downloaded and updated using the Steam client by following the steps described below on Linux, macOS, or Windows.

Download and install the Steam client for your operating system.

Once it is installed, open the client and login to your Steam account, or create an account if you don’t already have one. After logging in, navigate to the Store tab, search for “Blender”, and press the green Install button. Blender should now be available in the Library tab of the Steam client, where it can be launched. Optionally, a shortcut can be added to your desktop by right-clicking on it in your library list.

When installing Blender from Steam on Linux and Windows, the .blend filename extension will not be automatically associated with Blender. To associate blend-files with Blender, see the processes described on the Linux and Windows installation pages.

When an update for Blender is available on Steam, Steam will automatically download and apply the update for you.

- Graphics System (X11 & Wayland)¶
- Avoiding Alt-Mouse Conflict¶
- Updating on Linux¶
  - Updating from blender.org¶
  - Updating with a Package Manager¶

Check the Downloading Blender page to find the minimum requirements and the different versions that are available for Blender (if you have not done so yet).

Download the Linux version for your architecture and decompress the file to the desired location (e.g. ~/software or /usr/local).

Blender can now be launched by double-clicking the executable.

When using this method of installation, it is possible to have multiple versions of Blender installed.

For ease of access, you may wish to add a menu entry and create blend-file associations for the file-browser. This can be done by Registering Blender.

To make the installation and configuration fully self-contained, set up a Portable Installation.

Some Linux distributions may have a specific package for Blender in their repositories.

Installing Blender via the distribution’s native mechanisms ensures consistency with other packages on the system and may provide other features (given by the package manager), such as listing of packages, update notifications and automatic menu configuration. Be aware, though, that the package may be outdated compared to the latest official release, or not include some features of Blender. For example, some distributions do not build Blender with Cycles GPU rendering support, for licensing or other reasons.

If there is a specific package for your distribution, you may choose what is preferable and most convenient. Otherwise, the official binary is available on blender.org.

Snap is a universal package manager designed to work across a range of distributions. Assuming snap is already installed, Blender can be installed through snap with:

Installing from this method has a benefit that updates to Blender are automatically installed. Blender from Snap should have a more consistent distribution than individual package managers.

See Launching from the terminal.

Blender supports both X11 and Wayland. See Linux Windowing Environment for details.

Some window managers default to Alt-LMB and Alt-RMB for moving and resizing windows.

Blender uses these for various operations, notably:

Emulate 3 Button Mouse.

Changing multiple properties at once.

To access Blender’s full feature set, you can change the window manager settings to use the Meta key instead (also called Super or Windows key):

Enter the following in a command line (effective at next login):

System Settings ‣ Window Management ‣ Window Behavior ‣ Window Actions, Switch from ‘Alt’ to ‘Meta’ key.

On Linux there are two ways to update Blender. This section covers the most common approaches.

When an update for Blender is released, it can be downloaded directly from the Blender website and installed using the steps described in the section Install from blender.org.

Many Linux distributions have packages for Blender available, which can be installed using the distribution’s package manager. After installation, Blender can be updated using the same steps as updating any other application.

The Splash screen Defaults page for information about importing settings from previous Blender versions and other quick settings.

Extracting Blender’s archive using 7-zip is not supported. TAR must be used instead. For more details, see issue #104070.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
snap install blender --classic
```

Example 2 (typescript):
```typescript
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences mouse-button-modifier '<Super>'

Check the Downloading Blender page to find the minimum requirements and the different versions that are available for Blender (if you have not done so yet).

Download the zip-file or Windows Installer File.

Blender supports both x64 and arm64 architectures on Windows. Make sure to download a variant that is compatible with your CPU’s architecture.

The Windows installer will let you choose an installation folder, and will create an entry in the start menu as well as associate blend-files with Blender. It requires administrator rights.

When choosing the zip-file, you have to manually extract Blender to the desired folder, where you can double-click the executable to run Blender.

No start menu item will be created and no blend-file association will be registered, but there is also no need for administrator rights. You can register the file association manually by clicking Register on the System tab of the Preferences. Alternatively, you can run blender -r from the Command Line.

To make the installation and configuration fully self-contained, set up a Portable Installation.

Blender can be installed from the Microsoft Store by searching for Blender in the Microsoft Store and installing it.

After installation, Blender can now be launched from the Windows Start menu.

On Windows there are a few ways to update Blender. This section covers the most common approaches.

When an update for Blender is released, it can be downloaded directly from the Blender website. The Windows installer can then be run to install the updated version of Blender. To remove a previously installed version of Blender, use Windows settings or control panel to uninstall the desired version.

When an update for Blender is released, it can be downloaded directly from the Blender website and extracted to the desired folder, where you can double-click the executable to run Blender. For more information on creating a portable version of Blender, see the section Install from Zip.

Note, you do not have to overwrite your existing Blender installation. It’s perfectly possible to have multiple versions installed side by side.

When an update for Blender is available on the Microsoft Store, it will be downloaded and installed automatically.

## The Blender Community¶

**URL:** https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/getting_started/about/community.html

**Contents:**
- The Blender Community¶
- Independent Sites¶
- Getting Support¶
- Development¶
- Chat¶
- Other Useful Links¶

Being freely available from the start, even while it was closed source, considerably helped Blender’s adoption by the community. A large, stable, and active community of users has gathered around Blender since 1998. The community showed its support for Blender in 2002 when they helped raise €100,000 in seven weeks to enable Blender to go Open Source under the GNU GPL License.

There are several independent websites such as forums, blogs, news, and tutorial sites dedicated to Blender.

One of the largest community forums is Blender Artists, where Blender users gather to show off their creations, get feedback, ask and offer help and, in general, discuss Blender.

Blender’s community is one of its greatest features, so apart from this user manual, there are many different ways to get support from other users, such as Chat, Stack Exchange, and Reddit.

For studios and organizations there is Enterprise support, and for studios looking to add Blender to their pipeline, Blender Studio contains documentation and training material around this topic. If you think you have found an issue with Blender, please report a bug.

More details about support can be found on the support page.

Being open source, Blender welcomes development from volunteers. Communication between developers is done mostly through three platforms:

The projects.blender.org system

Online Chat (see below)

If you are interested in helping develop Blender, see the Get Involved page.

For real-time discussion, we have chat.blender.org which uses Blender ID for authentication.

You can join these channels:

#general For general chat with the community.

#blender-coders For developers to discuss Blender development.

#python For support for developers using the Python API.

#docs For discussion related to Blender’s documentation.

#translations For discussion related to translating Blender and its documentation.

Blender FAQ (Can I use Blender commercially? What is GPL/GNU? …)
