   - With `--files`: Additional "Files" column showing count, plus detailed file tables below
   - With `--json`: JSON output with optional file arrays

3. **File Details** (when `--files` is used):
   - For each assistant, shows a table of uploaded files
   - File information includes: name, status, and ID
   - File status color-coded (green=available, yellow=processing)
