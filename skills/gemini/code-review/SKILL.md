# CodeRabbit Code Review

AI-powered code review using CodeRabbit. Enables autonomous development workflows where you can implement features, review code, and fix issues without manual intervention.

## When to Use

When user asks to:

- Review code changes / Review my code / Review this
- Check code quality / Code quality check
- Find bugs or security issues / Check for bugs / Find issues
- Security review / Security check
- Get feedback on their code / PR review / Pull request feedback
- Review staged/uncommitted changes
- What's wrong with my code / What's wrong with my changes
- Run coderabbit / Use coderabbit
- Implement a feature and review it
- Fix issues found in review

## How to Review

### 1. Check Prerequisites

```bash
# Check CLI
coderabbit --version 2>/dev/null

# Check auth
