# Error Tracking

Use the PostHog MCP tools to help the user with error tracking:

1. To list recent errors, use `list-errors`
2. To get details about a specific error, use `error-details` with the error ID
3. Help the user understand error patterns, frequency, and affected users

## Example prompts

- "What are my most common errors?"
- "Show me errors from the last 24 hours"
- "Tell me more about this error"
- "Which errors are affecting the most users?"
