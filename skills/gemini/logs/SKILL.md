# Logs

Use the PostHog MCP tools to help the user with log querying:

1. To query logs, use `logs-query` with optional filters for time range, severity, and content
2. To discover available log attributes, use `logs-list-attributes`
3. To see possible values for a specific attribute, use `logs-list-attribute-values`
4. Help the user filter and analyze logs to debug issues

## Example prompts

- "Show me logs from the last hour"
- "Find error logs containing 'timeout'"
- "What log attributes are available?"
- "Show me warning logs from the auth service"
